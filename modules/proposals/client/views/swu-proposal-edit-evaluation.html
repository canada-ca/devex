    <h4>Evaluation Process</h4>
    <p>Evaluation of proposals will be by a committee formed by the Province and may include employees and
      contractors of the Province and other appropriate participants.</p>
    <p>The Province’s intent is to enter into a Contract with the Proponent who has met all mandatory
      criteria and minimum scores (if any) and who has the highest overall ranking.</p>
    <p>Proposals will be assessed in accordance with the entire requirement of the RFP, including mandatory
      and weighted criteria.</p>
    <p>The mandatory criteria are set forth in the following table. Proposals not clearly demonstrating that
      they meet the following mandatory criteria will be excluded from further consideration during the
      evaluation process.</p>

        <h5>Mandatory Criteria</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="card-body">
        <ul>
          <li>The Proponent must be a Qualified Supplier pursuant to the RFQ.</li>
          <li>The Proposal must be received at the Closing Location before the Closing Time.</li>

            requirement is satisfied.</li>
          <li>The Total Proponent Cost must not exceed the maximum budgeted amount for any individual Phase
            (if indicated) or the total budget in the aggregate, all as set forth on the Pricing tab.</li>
          <li>The RFP system will not permit a Proponent to submit a Proposal unless this mandatory

            contact name, phone number and email address.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Proposals that meet the mandatory criteria above will be evaluated with respect to the weighted
      criteria described in the scoring table below. The overall evaluation process is described by the
      following steps:</p>

    <h5>Step 1 - Technical Skills Screening</h5>
    <p>The Province will evaluate Proposals and assign points based on the preferred technical skills of
      Resources claimed by Proponents against the requirements set forth on the Select Team tab.</p>
    <p>The RFP system will automatically populate the Proponent’s Proposal for the preferred technical skills
      identified on the Select Team tab. Proponents should note that both Resource Capabilities and preferred
      technical skills are claimed as part of the Resource profile. It is the responsibility of the Proponent
      to ensure that the Resource profiles for a Proponent’s Team are fully accurate and up-to-date. Resource
      profiles can be updated at any time before the Closing Time.</p>
    <p>Proposals that have satisfied this step move on to step 2 below.</p>
    <h5>Step 2 - Team Questions</h5>
    <p>The Province will then evaluate the Proponent responses to the Team-based questions contained in the
      Team Questions tab that are specific to the Opportunity and are intended to (i) demonstrate a
      Proponent’s Resource experience working as a team; (ii) a Proponent’s experience with Agile software
      development; and (iii) demonstrate a Proponent’s experience working on a similar Product, with a
      similar scope and technical background.</p>
    <p>The Proponent’s responses to the Team-based questions should not reference organization name, Resource
      name, past projects or specific company software. No points will be awarded for any Proponent answer to
      any question in this step that references the Proponent’s organization name, Resource name, or specific
      company software.</p>
    <h5>Step 3 - Shortlisting</h5>
    <p>Based on their cumulative scores for steps 1 and 2, only the top four ranked Proponents (the
      “Shortlisted Proponents”) will then proceed to step 4 of the RFP process. The Shortlisted Proponents
      will be notified that they will be eligible to participate in the code challenge set out in step 4
      below.</p>
    <p>Notwithstanding the above, in the event that the fourth and fifth ranked Proponents are tied, the
      fifth ranked Proponent shall also be a Shortlisted Proponent and proceed to step 4 as outlined below.</p>
    <h5>Step 4 - Code Challenge</h5>
    <p>Shortlisted Proponents, who have progressed to this step will be invited to complete a code challenge,
      which will be comprised of user stories that outlines a basic business problem that needs to be solved
      by building a technical solution.</p>
    <p>Shortlisted Proponents will be notified of the details and applicable deadline of the code challenge.
      Shortlisted Proponents will be given two (2) Business Days to complete the challenge from the time they
      are notified. The code challenge will be evaluated according to the following criteria:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>functionality of the app;</li>
      <li>knowledge of the technology;</li>
      <li>code quality; and</li>
      <li>code organization.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For further details, Proponents should download the code challenge instructions located <a href="/terms/codechallenge"
        target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
    <p>Only those Shortlisted Proponents that have met the minimum score for step 4 will be eligible to
      participate in the in-person scenario described in step 5 below.</p>
    <p>Failure to meet the minimum score will mean that the Proponent’s Proposal will receive no further
      consideration and the Proponent will be eliminated from the competition.</p>
    <h5>Step 5 - Team Scenario</h5>
    <p>Shortlisted Proponents who have progressed to this step will be invited to participate in a Team
      scenario role-playing exercise. The eligible Proponent will be invited to arrange a date, time and
      place for the scenario, which must be completed within ten (10) Business Days from the deadline of the
      code challenge. Proponents may reschedule that date once within that time period, but if a Proponent
      otherwise fails to be available during the applicable time period for this step, such Proponent’s
      Proposal will receive no further consideration and the Proponent will be eliminated from the
      competition.</p>
    <p>In the team scenario, eligible Proponents will be given 1.5 hours to work as a team to role play and
      work with an individual role-playing a government product owner. Teams will be required to provide a
      solution to a fictitious business need or problem. At the beginning of this exercise, a Proponent Team
      will be given information regarding the problem, which is designed to require Proponents to demonstrate
      their Capabilities and demonstrate how they work as a team under pressure. Qualities to be evaluated
      will be leadership, teamwork and approach.</p>
    <p>Following the role-playing, this step will also include an interview component.</p>
    <p>The Team Scenario can be facilitated in person or by video conference. For further details, Proponents
      should download the team scenario exercise instructions located <a href="/terms/teamscenario"
        target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
    <h5>Step 6 - Price</h5>
    <p>The Total Proponent Cost (price) will be evaluated according to the following formula:</p>
    <p>The Proposal with the lowest overall Total Proponent Cost of all Proposals will receive the maximum
      points allocated to price.</p>
    <p>All other Proposals’ Total Proponent Cost will be evaluated using the following formula:</p>
    <div class="alert">
      <h5>S = <span style="text-decoration: underline">(Min x M)</span><br><span style="margin-left: 53px">P</span>
      </h5>
      S = score<br>
      M = total points available for price<br>
      Min = lowest priced proposal<br>
      P = price on this proposal
